## Roadmap of the design system

There will be two dimension for the development of the design system.
We break it down into two dimension, horizental development and vertical development and diagonal development which has been breaked down below:


## Vertical Development
Consist of Component-Driven-Development for the development of the design system. There are plenty of components with different levels of abstraction 
that could be used by software engineers.

## Horizental Development
Consist of design elements that help intergrity and consistency among the products. 

## Diagonal Development
Consist of architectural and foundational development of the design system
