## üîÑ Procedure

Some of the topics have a *Finish to Start* relation, but most of them are *Start to Start* ones, so we prioritize and implement them within three weeks.

First of all, we select topics and design them with **Figma**. And for the second, we discuss where we should restrict our user experience and give them the freedom to configure. As soon as shaping the solution, we start to develop it using **Typescript**.

## ‚èØ What have been done?

We've developed **TextInput** and **Button** components by now, that you can see on [undertheground.wishwork.org](https://undertheground.wishwork.org) 

## Next Step (Start: September 21)

For the next three weeks we will put **Fluid Grid**, **Checkbox**, **Radio Button** and **Dropdown** into effect.
