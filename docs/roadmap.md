Some of the topics have a *Finish to Start* relation but the most ones are *Start to Start*, so we priority and implement them within 3 weeks.

## Procedure

First of all we select topics and design them with **Figma**. Second, we discuss where we should restrict our user experience and where we should give them freedom to configure. As soon as shaping the solution we start to develop it using **Typescript**.

## What have done?

We have developed **TextInput** and **Button** components by now, which you can see them on [undertheground.wishwork.org](https://undertheground.wishwork.org) 

## Next Step (Start: September 21)

For the upcomming 3 weeks we will implement **Fluid Grid**, **Checkbox**, **Radio Button** and **Dropdown**.
