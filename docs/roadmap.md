Some the topics have a *Finish to Start* realation but the most ones are *Start to Start*, so we priority them and implement them within 3 weeks.
at the end of the period we will publish our packages.

## Procedure

First of all we select the topics and design it in **Figma**. Second we discuss about the props that where we shoud restrict our user experience and where we should give them ability to change. As soon as shaping the solution we start to develop it using **Typescript**.
