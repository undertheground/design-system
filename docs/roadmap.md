# Roadmap of the development of the design system

## Horizontal Development

It consists of design elements that help intergrity and consistency among the products. 

- `Colors (priority: 1)`
- `Grid System (priority: 2)`
- `Typography (priority: 3)`
- `Spacing (priority: 4)`
- `Theming (priority: 5)`

## Vertical Development

It consists of Component-Driven-Development for the development of the design system. There are plenty of components with different levels of abstraction 
that could be used by software engineers.

- `Button (priority: 1)`
- `Checkbox (priority: 2)`
- `Redio Button (priority: 2)`
- `Text Input (priority: 2)`
- `Drop Down (priority: 3)`
- `File Uplouder (priority: 3)`
- `Link (priority: 3)`
- `Cards (priority: 4)`
- `Date Picker (priority: 5)`
- `Select (priority: 5)`
- `Toggle (priority: 5)`
- `Search (priority: 6)`
- `Slider (priority: 6)`
- `Tags (priority: 6)`

## Diagonal Development

These are Mixed-Components which emerge from a combination of horizontal and vertical development.

- `Form (priority: 1)`
- `Navigation Bar (priority: 2)`
- `Footer (priority: 2)`
- `Modal Pages (priority: 3)`
- `Navigation slider (priority: 4)`
- `Data Table (priority: 5)`
- `Collapsible Content (priority: 6)`
- `Content Switcher (priority: 6)`

## Procedure

Some of the topics have a *Finish to Start* relation, but most of them are *Start to Start* ones, so we prioritize and implement them within three weeks.

First of all, we select topics and design them with **Figma**. And for the second, we discuss where we should restrict our user experience and give them the freedom to configure. As soon as shaping the solution, we start to develop it using **Typescript**.

## What have done?

We have developed **TextInput** and **Button** components by now, which you can see on [undertheground.wishwork.org](https://undertheground.wishwork.org) 

## Next Step (Start: September 21)

For the next three weeks we will implement **Fluid Grid**, **Checkbox**, **Radio Button** and **Dropdown**.
