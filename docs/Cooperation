# Cooperation

## Vetting process:
1- Interview.
2- Minor collaboration. (Usually, it takes about one week)

## Onboarding
1- We use Basecamp as a medium to share information, communication, and definition of tasks.
2- We use `Typescript` for developing components. 
3- Each component will be developed on a different branch.
4- The majority of the development is in two files, (example.tsx & example.stories.tsx). [read more](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction)
5- Each component is designed in Figma, and we use the `styled-components` library for the component's style.
6- If we need anything from Horizontal development, we consider developing it in a theme and using it in our component.
7- There should be a test file for the component.
8- All components after tests and QC will be merged on the `dev` branch.
9- If anything isn't wrong with the `dev` branch, it will be merged with the `main` branch and automatically publish the package. 

## Tasks
1- For the first task, you should check other [design systems](https://github.com/alexpate/awesome-design-systems) and define components' functional attributes (e.g., component has id, disabled, onChange, etc.).
2- As a software engineer, you will define your tasks. If there were any problems with task definition, your manager would help you.
3- Put your manager's name to notify when your task is done.
4- By completing the task, push your codes on GitHub with the topic of the task as a commit message.
5- When your task is done, please update the `hill chart` and write its description.
