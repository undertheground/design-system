# Cooperation

## Vetting process:
- Interview.
- Minor collaboration. (Usually, it takes about one week)

## Onboarding
- We use Basecamp as a medium to share information, communication, and definition of tasks.
- We use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for developing components. 
- Each component will be developed on a different branch.
- The majority of the development is in two files, (`example.tsx` & `example.stories.tsx`). [read more](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/introduction)
- Each component is designed in `Figma`, and we use the `styled-components` library for the component's style.
- If we need anything from `Horizontal development`, we consider developing it in a `theme` and using it in our component.
- There should be a test file for the component.
- All components after tests and QC will be merged on the `dev` branch.
- If anything isn't wrong with the `dev` branch, it will be merged with the `main` branch and automatically publish the package. 

## Tasks
- For the first task, you should check other [design systems](https://github.com/alexpate/awesome-design-systems) and define components' functional attributes (e.g., component has id, disabled, onChange, etc.).
- As a software engineer, you will define your tasks. If there were any problems with task definition, your manager would help you.
- Put your manager's name to notify when your task is done.
- By completing the task, `push` your codes on `GitHub` with the topic of the task as a commit message.
- When your task is done, please update the `hill chart` and write its description.
