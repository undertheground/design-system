## Overview 
Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. 
They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. Button labels 
express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

<h6 className={'header'}>When to use</h6>

Use buttons to communicate actions users can take and to allow users to interact with the page. 
Each page should have one primary button, and any remaining calls to action should be represented as lower emphasis buttons.

<h6 className={'header'}>When not to use</h6>

Do not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use links when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.

## Button Variants
Each button variant has a particular function and its design signals that function to the user. 
It is therefore very important that the different variants are implemented consistently across products, 
so that they message the correct actions.

## Anatomy
The main element in buttons is the label of that button, 
as it represents the action that will be performed when the user interacts with it. All buttons label are hold 
placed in the center. Even with icon, the group of label and icon should be in the center of button.
